- ### Capstone Projects

	- [Predicting one has diabetics or not](https://github.com/sayarsamanta/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Healthcare%20Diabetics/healthcare_pgp_sayar_samanta.ipynb): NIDDK (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) research creates knowledge about and treatments for the most chronic, costly, and consequential diseases.The dataset used in this project is originally from NIDDK. The objective is to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.
	- [Customer segmentation using RFM and Cohort analysis](https://github.com/sayarsamanta/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Retail%20Analysys/retail_sayar_pgp_capstone.ipynb): It is a critical requirement for business to understand the value derived from a customer. RFM is a method used for analyzing customer value.Customer segmentation is the practice of segregating the customer base into groups of individuals based on some common characteristics such as age, gender, interests, and spending habits.Perform customer segmentation using RFM analysis. The resulting segments can be ordered from most valuable (highest recency, frequency, and value) to least valuable (lowest recency, frequency, and value).
