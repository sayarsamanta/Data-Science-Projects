# Portfolio for Data Science
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic (PGP Data Science). Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks

- ### Capstone Projects

	- [Predicting one has diabetics or not](https://github.com/sayarsamanta/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Healthcare%20Diabetics/healthcare_pgp_sayar_samanta.ipynb): NIDDK (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) research creates knowledge about and treatments for the most chronic, costly, and consequential diseases.The dataset used in this project is originally from NIDDK. The objective is to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.
	- [Customer segmentation using RFM and Cohort analysis](https://github.com/sayarsamanta/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Retail%20Analysys/retail_sayar_pgp_capstone.ipynb): It is a critical requirement for business to understand the value derived from a customer. RFM is a method used for analyzing customer value.Customer segmentation is the practice of segregating the customer base into groups of individuals based on some common characteristics such as age, gender, interests, and spending habits.Perform customer segmentation using RFM analysis. The resulting segments can be ordered from most valuable (highest recency, frequency, and value) to least valuable (lowest recency, frequency, and value).

	_Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Tableau

- ### Machine Learning Projects
	- [Amazon movie recommendation for user](https://github.com/sayarsamanta/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Amazon%20Recommendation/RecommendationExample.ipynb): Building user-based recommendation model for Amazon.The dataset provided contains movie reviews given by Amazon customers. Reviews were given between May 1996 and July 2014.Some of the movies hadn’t been watched and therefore, are not rated by the users. Netflix would like to take this as an opportunity and build a machine learning recommendation algorithm which provides the ratings for each of the users.
 	- [Mercedes-Benz Greener Manufacturing](https://github.com/sayarsamanta/Data-Science-Projects/blob/main/Mercedes%20Benz/Mercedes-Benz%20Greener%20Manufacturing%20Sayar%20Samanta.ipynb): Reduce the time a Mercedes-Benz spends on the test bench.We are required to reduce the time that cars spend on the test bench. Others will work with a dataset representing different permutations of features in a Mercedes-Benz car to predict the time it takes to pass testing. Optimal algorithms will contribute to faster testing, resulting in lower carbon dioxide emissions without reducing Mercedes-Benz’s standards.
